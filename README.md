## About ICPC

The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is a prestigious programming competition for university students from around the world. Teams of three students work together to solve a set of programming problems within a specified time frame. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and more.
